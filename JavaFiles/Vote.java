      1) Use Queue's .front() method to present the user with the next dog. In actual implementation, we'll need something more intricate to actually display all of the data.
      2) Apply the vote. Again, it'll be more intricate in the final implementation because it will have to wait for the user to actually click something.
      3) Perform calculations
      4) Check if leaderboard needs to be updated
      5) Add to votedOnBy
