To-do:

Change VotingQueue to be compatible with Dog instead of int

Update UML class diagram to match up with actual implementation

decide if Dog needs ranking stored in Database or if comparisons will just be made

Change DOB to Date class


Note: -votedOnBy: ArrayList<Integer> has been replaced by the table voteList. Each row in the table will correspond to a user who has voted on a particular dog.
